# effingo
*effingo* is the latin word for copy. 

This is a web browser extension to count number of times texts was copied. 

## Motivation
As a software engineer, majority of code we write does not necessarily come from ourself. We tend to copy others. May it be on Stackoverflow, any other page on Google and now, Chatgpt. 
I wanted a way to keep track of howmany times I have copied texts on a page web browser. This can then help me assess my productivity while copying stuff vs when writing code from my head straight. 
Another motivation would be for fun! This is my first browser extension so, don't be mad if it does not work perfectly! 

## Supported brwoser
As a start, this is currently supported on Coogle Chrome.
